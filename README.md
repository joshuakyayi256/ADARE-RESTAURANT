# How to Open and View the Figma File

## 1. Access the GitHub Repository

Visit your GitHub repository where the Figma file is hosted. Ensure that the file is publicly accessible or that you've granted appropriate permissions to viewers.

## 2. Locate the Figma File

Identify the Figma file you want to share. It may have a `.fig` or `.figma` or '.jam' file extension.

## 3. Get the File's URL

Click on the Figma file to open it. In the file preview, you'll find an option to "View raw." Right-click on this option and choose "Copy link address" to get the direct URL to the file.

## 4. Open Figma in a Web Browser

Users can view Figma files using a web browser, and this method works on both Windows and Mac:

   - Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
   - Paste the copied URL into the browser's address bar and press Enter.

## 5. Sign In or Create a Figma Account

To view the Figma file, users may need to sign in or create a free Figma account if they don't already have one. This step is essential for accessing shared Figma files.

## 6. Explore the Figma Design

Once signed in, users can explore the Figma file directly in their web browser. They can interact with the design, inspect elements, and provide feedback if necessary.

## 7. Optional: Export or Duplicate the Design

Users can also export or duplicate the design if they need to work on it further. The specific options for this will depend on your sharing settings.
